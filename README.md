# Part II Project (package name TBC)

Using Python 3.7.8

## Packages needed

Install these with `pip3` or something beforehand

- `numpy`
- `networkx`
- `antlr`

## Running it

Run with something like `python3 main.py samples/sample_1.txt`
There are no output options for now, this should parse the input file, print out the tikz code and automatically open a PDF with the generated diagram
